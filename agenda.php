/*
Abstract classes and methods are key concepts in PHP OOP, especially when you want to define a blueprint for other classes. An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly; it is meant to be extended by other classes. It can contain both abstract and non-abstract methods.

An abstract method, on the other hand, is a method that is declared in an abstract class but doesn’t have any implementation. The implementation must be provided by the child classes.
