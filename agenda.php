Overloading allows dynamic creation of methods and properties in classes.

Overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its parent class.

Overloading in PHP isn't the same as it is in languages like Java or C++. PHP does not support traditional method overloading (where you define multiple methods with the same name but different parameters). Instead, PHP allows you to dynamically handle inaccessible or undefined methods or properties using magic methods like __call(), __callStatic(), __get(), and __set().
