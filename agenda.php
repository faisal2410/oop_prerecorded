Data Abstraction is one of the key principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It allows you to hide the complex implementation details of a class while exposing only the essential features to the user.

Think of it as focusing on "what" an object can do, rather than "how" it does it. For example, when you use a TV remote, you know which buttons to press to change channels or adjust the volume, but you don't need to understand the internal mechanisms of how the remote works.

Benefits of Data Abstraction:

Encapsulation of Complex Logic: Abstraction hides unnecessary details and exposes only the essentials.
Security: It prevents external entities from accessing sensitive parts of the code.
Ease of Use: Simplifies the interaction between classes and reduces the chance of errors.
Maintainability: Changes to the internal implementation do not affect the external interface, making the system easier to maintain.

In PHP, we achieve data abstraction using two primary tools:

Abstract Classes
Interfaces
