/*
An interface in PHP is a contract that defines a set of methods that a class must implement, without providing any actual logic for those methods. Think of it as a blueprint for a class. By using interfaces, you ensure that certain methods are defined in a class, but you leave it up to the class to decide how to implement those methods.

Key Points to Explain:

Interfaces are purely abstract; they don’t have any code in their methods.
Any class that implements an interface must provide concrete implementations for the methods defined in the interface.
