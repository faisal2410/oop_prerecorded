/*

Data encapsulation is one of the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming. In simple terms, it refers to the practice of hiding the internal details of a class while exposing only the necessary parts to the outside world.


In PHP, we achieve encapsulation by setting the visibility of class properties and methods using access modifiers:

public: Accessible from anywhere.
private: Accessible only within the class itself.
protected: Accessible within the class and its subclasses.

✅Benefits of Data Encapsulation

1.Data Protection: Sensitive data is hidden from unauthorized access.
2.Controlled Access: You can control how data is accessed and modified using methods like getters and setters.
3.Maintainability: It makes your code more modular and easier to maintain or refactor.
4.Reduced Complexity: Encapsulation hides unnecessary details from the outside world, reducing complexity.
